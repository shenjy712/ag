```

### Clone this repo to local

- clone repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/shenjy712/ag.git
```
- `.env` file
```
API_KEY=
API_BASE_URI=https://api.siliconflow.cn
MODEL=deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3
```
> The large model API used above is the API of Silicon Flow. You can also use the API of Silicon Flow, [Register Silicon Flow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/BLu934tI)

- generate API KEY
